Selection
=================

.. versionadded:: 1.8

.. warning::

    This code is still experimental, and its API is subject to change in a
    future version.

:class:`Selection` provides selection operations for adapters and controllers.

Elements that control selection behaviour:

* *selection*, a list of selected items.

* *selection_mode*, 'single', 'multiple', 'none'

* *allow_empty_selection*, a boolean -- If False, a selection is forced. If
  True, and only user or programmatic action will change selection, it can
  be empty.

Users of this class dispatch the *on_selection_change* event.

    :Events:
        `on_selection_change`: (view, view list )
            Fired when selection changes, more generally, as when selection is
            set entirely, or when any operation is performed, per the gross
            dispatching done via ObservableList.
        `on_selection`: (view, view list, op_info)
            Fired when selection changes, as when selection is set entirely, or
            specifically on a per-op basis. When any operation is performed,
            dispatching done via OpObservableList, which sends along an op_info
            argument containing details about what changed.

.. versionchanged:: 1.8.0

    Broke this code out of :class:`ListAdapter` into a separate mixin class
    that is used in Adapter. This way all adapters have selection available.

    Added a new bind_selection_to_children property to allow control of
    selection for composite widgets.

    Added convenience methods, get_selection() and get_first_selected_item().

    Changed the way select_list() and deselect_list() avoid uneeded
    dispatching, which allows the API to include the usual binding to
    selection, as compared to the original way, where only binding to
    on_selection_change was suggested.

    Added use of OpObservableList in the selection list, mainly to use a new
    batch_delete() method made for revised select_list() and deselect_list()
    methods. This is part of a change to allow selection to be observed
    directly, in addition to the already available on_selection_change event.
    Now either of the following will work, but have differing types of events
    associated:

        1) ...adapter.bind(selection=some_method)
             or
           ...adapter.bind(on_selection=some_method)

            Events are per-op dispatches, with an additional argument, op_info,
            available if an observer needs more detailed change info.

        2) ...adapter.bind(on_selection_change=some_method)

            Events are the regular type, where dispatches happen as a result of
            the list being set, or as a result of any change (There is no
            op_info detail available).

    Moved selection.py out of kivy/adapters to kivy/, to allow use in
    traditional controllers, which do not do item view creation and caching
    covered by adapters.

    propagate_selection_to_data = BooleanProperty(False)
    '''Normally, data items are not selected/deselected because the data items
    might not have an is_selected boolean property -- only the item view for a
    given data item is selected/deselected as part of the maintained selection
    list. However, if the data items do have an is_selected property, or if
    they mix in :class:`~kivy.adapters.models.SelectableDataItem`, the
    selection machinery can propagate selection to data items. This can be
    useful for storing selection state in a local database or backend database
    for maintaining state in game play or other similar scenarios. It is a
    convenience function.

    NOTE: This would probably be better named as sync_selection_with_data().

    To propagate selection or not?

    Consider a shopping list application for shopping for fruits at the
    market. The app allows for the selection of fruits to buy for each day of
    the week, presenting seven lists: one for each day of the week. Each list is
    loaded with all the available fruits, but the selection for each is a
    subset. There is only one set of fruit data shared between the lists, so
    it would not make sense to propagate selection to the data because
    selection in any of the seven lists would clash and mix with that of the
    others.

    However, consider a game that uses the same fruits data for selecting
    fruits available for fruit-tossing. A given round of play could have a
    full fruits list, with fruits available for tossing shown selected. If the
    game is saved and rerun, the full fruits list, with selection marked on
    each item, would be reloaded correctly if selection is always propagated to
    the data. You could accomplish the same functionality by writing code to
    operate on list selection, but having selection stored in the data
    ListProperty might prove convenient in some cases.

    :data:`propagate_selection_to_data` is a
    :class:`~kivy.properties.BooleanProperty` and defaults to False.

    allow_empty_selection = BooleanProperty(True)
    '''The allow_empty_selection may be used for cascading selection between
    several list views, or between a list view and an observing view. Such
    automatic maintenance of the selection is important for all but simple
    list displays. Set allow_empty_selection to False and the selection is
    auto-initialized and always maintained, so any observing views
    may likewise be updated to stay in sync.
