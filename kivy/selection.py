Selection
=================

.. versionadded:: 1.8

.. warning::

    This code is still experimental, and its API is subject to change in a
    future version.

:class:`Selection` provides selection operations for adapters and controllers.

Elements that control selection behaviour:

* *selection*, a list of selected items.

* *selection_mode*, 'single', 'multiple', 'none'

* *allow_empty_selection*, a boolean -- If False, a selection is forced. If
  True, and only user or programmatic action will change selection, it can
  be empty.

    :Events:
        `on_selection_change`: (selectable_item, selectable_item list )
            Fired when selection changes, more generally, as when selection is
            set entirely, or when any operation is performed, per the gross
            dispatching done via ObservableList.
        `on_selection`: (selectable_item, selectable_item list, op_info)
            This event works the same way, except that there is no actual
            dispatching via calls in the code, but by the default ListProperty
            (and its ObservableList) and normal data change events.

.. versionchanged:: 1.8.0

    Broke this code out of :class:`ListAdapter` into a separate mixin class
    that is used in Adapter. This way all adapters have selection available.

    Added a new bind_selection_to_children property to allow control of
    selection for composite widgets.

    Added convenience methods, get_selection() and get_first_selected_item().

    Changed the way select_list() and deselect_list() avoid uneeded
    dispatching, which allows the API to include the usual binding to
    selection, as compared to the original way, where only binding to
    on_selection_change was suggested.

    Added a batch_delete() to ObservableList in the selection list This method
    is for calling from revised select_list() and deselect_list() methods. This
    is part of a change to allow selection to be observed directly, to replace
    the on_selection_change event.  Now either of the following will work, but
    the first is preferred:

        1) ...adapter.bind(selection=some_method)

        2) ...adapter.bind(on_selection_change=some_method)

    Events are the normal type, where dispatches happen as a result of the
    list being set, or as a result of any change.

    Moved selection.py out of kivy/adapters to kivy/, to allow use in
    traditional controllers, which do not do item view creation and caching
    covered by adapters.

    Changed references to view, item_view, and view_list to selectable_item,
    item, and selectable_item_list, to make it clear that Selection work with
    non-view items, as are used in traditional controllers. Also, changed many
    references for data item to model data item, to make the distinction
    between selectable data items, the items for which selection is maintained,
    and associated model data. Selectable items are view instances for
    adapters, but they may be normal Python class instances for controllers.
    Model data can be anything, even Python class instances, but more typically
    consists of primitives such as integers, floats, strings, or dicts with
    those, etc.

    Deprecated propagate_selection_to_data, in favor of sync_with_model_data.

    '''

    sync_with_model_data = BooleanProperty(False)
    '''Normally, model data items are not selected/deselected because the model
    data items might not have an is_selected boolean property -- only the
    selectable_item for a given model data item is selected/deselected as part
    of the maintained selection list. However, if the model data items do have
    an is_selected property, or if they mix in
    :class:`~kivy.adapters.models.SelectableDataItem`, the selection machinery
    can sync selection with model data items. This can be useful for storing
    selection state in a local database or backend database for maintaining
    state in game play or other similar scenarios. It is a convenience
    function.

    To sync selection or not?

    Consider a shopping list application for shopping for fruits at the market.
    The app allows for the selection of fruits to buy for each day of the week,
    presenting seven lists: one for each day of the week. Each list is loaded
    with all the available fruits, but the selection for each is a subset.
    There is only one set of fruit model data shared between the lists, so it
    would not make sense to sync selection with the model data because
    selection in any of the seven lists would clash and mix with that of the
    others.

    However, consider a game that uses the same fruits model data for selecting
    fruits available for fruit-tossing. A given round of play could have a full
    fruits list, with fruits available for tossing shown selected. If the game
    is saved and rerun, the full fruits list, with selection marked on each
    item, would be reloaded correctly if selection is always synced to the
    model data. You could accomplish the same functionality by writing code to
    operate on list selection, but having selection stored in the data
    ListProperty might prove convenient in some cases.

    :data:`sync_with_model_data` is a
    :class:`~kivy.properties.BooleanProperty` and defaults to False.

    auto-initialized and always maintained, so any observing views
